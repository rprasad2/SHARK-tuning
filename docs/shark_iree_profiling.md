# Overview

This document is intended to provide a starting point for profiling with SHARK/IREE. At it's core
[SHARK](https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK/tree/main/tank) is a python API that links the MLIR lowerings from various
frameworks + frontends (e.g. PyTorch -> Torch-MLIR) with the compiler + runtime offered by IREE. More information
on model coverage and framework support can be found [here](https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK/tree/main/tank). The intended
use case for SHARK is for compilation and deployment of performant state of the art AI models.

## Benchmarking with SHARK

TODO: Expand this section.

SHARK offers native benchmarking support, although because it is model focused, fine grain profiling is
hidden when compared against the common "model benchmarking suite" use case SHARK is good at.

### SharkBenchmarkRunner

SharkBenchmarkRunner is a class designed for benchmarking models against other runtimes.
TODO: List supported runtimes for comparison + example on how to benchmark with it.

## Directly profiling IREE

A number of excellent developer resources on profiling with IREE can be
found [here](https://github.com/iree-org/iree/tree/main/docs/developers/developing_iree). As a result this section will
focus on the bridging the gap between the two.
 - https://github.com/iree-org/iree/blob/main/docs/developers/developing_iree/profiling.md
 - https://github.com/iree-org/iree/blob/main/docs/developers/developing_iree/profiling_with_tracy.md
 - https://github.com/iree-org/iree/blob/main/docs/developers/developing_iree/profiling_vulkan_gpu.md
 - https://github.com/iree-org/iree/blob/main/docs/developers/developing_iree/profiling_cpu_events.md

Internally, SHARK builds a pair of IREE commands to compile + run a model. At a high level the flow starts with the
model represented with a high level dialect (commonly Linalg) and is compiled to a flatbuffer (.vmfb) that
the runtime is capable of ingesting. At this point (with potentially a few runtime flags) the compiled model is then run
through the IREE runtime. This is all facilitated with the IREE python bindings, which offers a convenient method
to capture the compile command SHARK comes up with. This is done by setting the environment variable
`IREE_SAVE_TEMPS` to point to a directory of choice, e.g. for stable diffusion
```
# Linux
$ export IREE_SAVE_TEMPS=/path/to/some/directory
# Windows
$ $env:IREE_SAVE_TEMPS="C:\path\to\some\directory"
$ python apps/stable_diffusion/scripts/txt2img.py -p "a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse" --save_vmfb
```
NOTE: Currently this will only save the compile command + input MLIR for a single model if run in a pipeline.
In the case of stable diffusion this (should) be UNet so to get examples for other models in the pipeline they
need to be extracted and tested individually.

The save temps directory should contain three files: `core-command-line.txt`, `core-input.mlir`, and `core-output.bin`.
The command line for compilation will start something like this, where the `-` needs to be replaced with the path to `core-input.mlir`.
```
/home/quinn/nod/iree-build/compiler/bindings/python/iree/compiler/tools/../_mlir_libs/iree-compile - --iree-input-type=none ...
```
The `-o output_filename.vmfb` flag can be used to specify the location to save the compiled vmfb. Note that a dump of the
dispatches that can be compiled + run in isolation can be generated by adding `--iree-hal-dump-executable-benchmarks-to=/some/directory`. Say, if they are in the `benchmarks` directory, the following compile/run commands would work for Vulkan on RDNA3.
```
iree-compile --iree-input-type=none --iree-hal-target-backends=vulkan --iree-vulkan-target-triple=rdna3-unknown-linux --iree-stream-resource-index-bits=64 --iree-vm-target-index-bits=64 benchmarks/module_forward_dispatch_${NUM}_vulkan_spirv_fb.mlir -o benchmarks/module_forward_dispatch_${NUM}_vulkan_spirv_fb.vmfb

iree-benchmark-module --module=benchmarks/module_forward_dispatch_${NUM}_vulkan_spirv_fb.vmfb --function=forward --device=vulkan
```
Where `${NUM}` is the dispatch number that you want to benchmark/profile in isolation.

### Enabling Tracy for Vulkan profiling

To begin profiling with Tracy, a build of IREE runtime with tracing enabled is needed. SHARK-Runtime builds an
instrumented version alongside the normal version nightly (.whls typically found [here](https://github.com/nod-ai/SHARK-Runtime/releases)), however this is only available for Linux. For Windows, tracing can be enabled by enabling a CMake flag.
```
$env:IREE_ENABLE_RUNTIME_TRACING="ON"
```
Getting a trace can then be done by setting environment variable `TRACY_NO_EXIT=1` and running the program that is to be
traced. Then, to actually capture the trace, use the `iree-tracy-capture` tool in a different terminal. Note that to get
the capture and profiler tools the `IREE_BUILD_TRACY=ON` CMake flag needs to be set.
```
TRACY_NO_EXIT=1 python apps/stable_diffusion/scripts/txt2img.py -p "a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse"

# (in another terminal, either on the same machine or through ssh with a tunnel through port 8086)
iree-tracy-capture -o trace_filename.tracy
```
To do it over ssh, the flow looks like this
```
# From terminal 1 on local machine
ssh -L 8086:localhost:8086 <remote_server_name>
TRACY_NO_EXIT=1 python apps/stable_diffusion/scripts/txt2img.py -p "a photograph of an astronaut riding a horse"

# From terminal 2 on local machine. Requires having built IREE with the CMake flag `IREE_BUILD_TRACY=ON` to build the required tooling.
iree-tracy-capture -o /path/to/trace.tracy
```

The trace can then be viewed with
```
iree-tracy-profiler /path/to/trace.tracy
```
Capturing a runtime trace will work with any IREE tooling that uses the runtime. For example, `iree-benchmark-module`
can be used for benchmarking an individual module. Importantly this means that any SHARK script can be profiled with tracy.

NOTE: Not all backends have the same tracy support. This writeup is focused on CPU/Vulkan backends but there is recently added support for tracing on CUDA (requires the `--cuda_tracing` flag).

## Experimental RGP support

TODO: This section is temporary until proper RGP support is added.

Currently, for stable diffusion there is a flag for enabling UNet to be visible to RGP with `--enable_rgp`. To get a proper capture though, the `DevModeSqttPrepareFrameCount=1` flag needs to be set for the driver (done with `VkPanel` on Windows).
With these two settings, a single iteration of UNet can be captured.

(AMD only) To get a dump of the pipelines (result of compiled SPIR-V) the `EnablePipelineDump=1` driver flag can be set. The
files will typically be dumped to a directory called `spvPipeline` (on Linux `/var/tmp/spvPipeline`. The dumped files will
include header information that can be used to map back to the source dispatch/SPIR-V, e.g.
```
[Version]
version = 57 

[CsSpvFile]
fileName = Shader_0x946C08DFD0C10D9A.spv

[CsInfo]
entryPoint = forward_dispatch_193_matmul_256x65536x2304
```
