# Vision Inference Sample (C code)

This sample demonstrates how to run a MNIST handwritten digit detection vision
model on an image using IREE's C API.

A similar sample is implemented using a Python script and IREE's command line
tools over in the primary iree repository at
https://github.com/iree-org/iree/tree/main/samples/vision_inference
